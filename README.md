# Simple Create
Simple Create is a modpack based around [Create mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/Xbc0uyRg). It's designed to be a fun experience with the Boys, but can be played alone if you so wish.

## State of Project
This modpack is relatively complete, but it's still in beta, because several mods cannot be added to the modpack due to stability reasons or the mods just being unfinished. This includes [Create Simulated](https://discord.gg/createaeronautics) and it's addons, [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/uCdwusMi) and [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/VSNURh3q).  
Do note that we do currently use [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/VSNURh3q), however only on the server side.

### 1.20.1
As soon as all mods that are currently in use work for this version of Minecraft, we'll update.

## Other Repositories
[Packwiz Modded](https://github.com/MentoskaPraha/packwiz-modded) - modified version of packwiz used to create and maintain this modpack.
