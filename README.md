# Simple Create
Simple Create is a modpack intends on creating a relatively simple and fun environment centered on the [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/Xbc0uyRg) mod in which to play Minecraft with one's friends in. For this reason a client and server versions of the modpack are provided. This modpack does make a few changes to some of Minecraft's core systems such as enchanting and exploration. If you do not like these changes feel free to disable them or remove the mods that make them.

This modpack is focused on create a simple, light and fun environment to play Minecraft with your friends in, you are therefore allowed to modify and redistribute the modpack as you see fit, please do credit Gljue, who made the icon, if you do decide to keep that aspect of the modpack.

## Mods that you may not like
The [Enchancement](https://modrinth.com/mod/6hN1V6wJ) mod, while fun, rebalances enchanting completely. Some players don't like these changes, however the mod makes up for the hard nerfs to enchanting with new, fun and interesting enchantements, however if it's not for you feel free to remove it.

Mods that rework how Minecraft generates its terrain may also be something you do not enjoy. However these do provide new and fresh environments for you to explore, so I suggest you give them a chance.

There are also some client side mods that you may find annoying, feel free to remove these if you do.

At the end of the day you need to find what works for you and your friends.

## Recommendations
Some things don't have to be changed with mods. There are a lot of cool datapacks out there, I'd check out [Vanilla Tweak](https://vanillatweaks.net/), they have a lot of good datapacks and crafting tweaks that work with vanilla and modded Minecraft, they also have really cool resource packs.

If you want something out of this world I'd also check out [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/3ufwT9JF) and all of its extensions, as it adds space exploration to Minecraft and can be integrated with the [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/Xbc0uyRg) mod. This might become a part of the modpack one day if we decide.

I'd also check out [Create: Aeronautics]( https://discord.gg/createaeronautics) which is currently unfinished, but will add physics based contraptions to [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/Xbc0uyRg) and it'll be definitely added to this modpack once released.

Again these are recommendations and this modpack is meant to serve as inspiration or a jumping off point for you and your friends, so that you can play Minecraft in a way you want to.

## Hosting
This modpack uses [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/en/) as the modloader. Please see their [website](https://quiltmc.org/en/) for details on how to install the client and/or server. If you're using a custom launcher like the [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/), please refer to your launchers instructions on how to install modpacks. Most commonly used launchers support the Modrinth modpack format.

For the server admin's convenience  we have created a separate modpack version which removes all client-side only mods and adds a few useful server utilities, like [Discord Integration](https://modrinth.com/plugin/rbJ7eS5V) and [Fast Backups](https://modrinth.com/mod/ZHKrK8Rp).

Please do note that [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/9eGKb6K1) requires extra configuration.

We've also included a mod list in this description where you can find all the mods we've used, whether they are needed on the client or server and whether they are ready for 1.20.

## 1.20
We plan on updating to 1.20 as soon as all of the mods in this pack support it. For a full list of mods and whether they support 1.20 see bellow.

## Conclusion and Credits
Big thanks once again to Gljue, who was too lazy to create a Modrinth account, and who create the modpack's icon and helped compile all the mods. I'd also like to thank all the modders who wrote all the mods in this modpack you guys are absolute chads.

I'd also also like to say once again that this modpack is meant to serve as an inspiration, so that you can fine-tune it in order to play the game you want to play. If you don't like something about this modpack feel free to change it.

Enjoy the modlist!

### Compatibility Notes
- The modpack is using Kotlin for Fabric instead of Quilt Kotlin Libraries for compatibility reasons. Once on `1.20.1` we should be able to switch back to QKL.
- A custom version of Farmer's Delight is used as it causes issues with Create: Steam 'n' Rails and this version fixes that.
